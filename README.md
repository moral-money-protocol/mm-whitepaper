# 🪙 MM –  Moral Money  
### A Stateless, Ethical, Post-Cryptocurrency Currency for the Moral Economy

---
Assalam o Alaikum,

**MM** is an open-source, non-owned, AI-governed, post-crypto currency system rooted in *ethical action*, *Islamic economic principles*, and *community trust*. It is not built for speculation, profit, or power — but to enable a just and decentralized moral economy for all.

## 🧭 Vision

To create a **universal currency** that rewards **virtue, service, knowledge, and moral work** — not greed, hype, or capital. MM is money not for control, but for contribution.

We aim to build:
- A decentralized ethical minting engine  
- A free wallet for everyone  
- An open protocol for earning, spending, and verifying moral value  
- A self-sustaining post-fiat, post-crypto currency for the future Ummah and beyond

## 🤲 Final Word

This is not a project.  
This is **a response to global injustice, economic decay, and spiritual emptiness.**  
UMM is not owned because *Truth* cannot be owned.  
Help us build a money system that’s not built on profit, but on **virtue**.

> *Bismillah. Let’s start.*
